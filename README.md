# Entertainment Services APIs #

Entertainment services (a.k.a., Ent Setvices) APIs are a set of JSON-RPC based RESTful services that provide access to various functionalities in the entertainment devices that are powered by RDK middleware and ENTOS Operating System. App developers who would like to make use of the underlying features in the ENTOS powered entertainment devices MAY refer this documentation to write, test and deploy their apps in those devices.

Ent Services APIs are maintained and managed through a specific governance model. Please make sure you are aware of all the details covered in the [governance document ](./governance.md) before you start contributing. 

If you would like to contribute to this project, please fork this project and raise the PR. You will be contacted by one of the members of the governance team.

## Documentation ##

**Note:** Review [Governance](./governance) document for detailed information on API specification guidelines.

- By default, the APIs are defined / described using header file so COMRPC is inherently supported by default (Refer entservices-apis/apis/<service name>/<servicename>.h for example)

- API documentation is generated directly from the API header files themselves. This ensures a single-source-of-truth, as opposed to creating a JSON for documentation. Using JSON to generate documentation has been deprecated. 

- To generate documentation, the header files should have doxygen comments and descriptions as specified in this [README](./tools/md_from_h_generator/README.md). The README also contains information on running the tool locally. The IFrameRate.h and IUSBMassStorage.h plugin header files are examples of supported Doxygen tagging.

- Markdown files are generated from the header file definitions using the md_from_h_generator tool (tools/md_from_h_generator/generate_md_from_header.py).

- The tool
The generator tool requires:

* Python 3.8.10 or higher

Verify your Python version:

```shell
python --version
```

### Generating Markdown for a Single Service ###

To generate markdown for a single service:

1. Change directories to `tools/md_generator/json2md`.
2. Run `generator_json.py` and provide the location of the service JSON plugin file using the `-d` argument and the output directory using the `-o` argument. You must also include the `--no-interfaces-section` argument; otherwise, an interface section is added to the markdown. Make certain that you are pointing to the plugin definition and not the interface definition. Here is an example of using the tool:

    ```shell
    python ./generator_json.py -d ../../../apis/MyService/MyServicePlugin.json  -o ../../../docs/apis --no-interfaces-section --verbose $files
    ```

    The `MyServicePlugin.md` file is written to the `../../../docs/apis` folder. This is the standard directory where all the service API markdown files are written.

### Generating Markdown for All Services ###

A script is provided to generate the markdown for all services and does a complete build of the documentation. The script only generates the markdown for a service if the JSON definition has been updated. In addition, the script post-processes the generated markdown files to create standard link anchors and to clean the build.

To generate markdown for all services:

1. From the entservices-apis repository, change directories to `tools/md_generator`.
2. Run `generate_md.py`. For example:

    ```shell
    python ./generate_md.py
    ```

    All markdown files are written to the `../../docs/apis` folder. This is the standard directory where all the service API markdown files are written.

Use the existing services as a guide when learning the structure of both the plugin and interface schemas.

## Coding Guidelines ##

** Note:*: Refer [governance](./governance.md) document for more specific coding guidelines while the below sub section provides "generic" guidelines.

1. Be Consistent

    * The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you’re saying rather than on how you’re saying it.

    * If the code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm. Avoid this.

    * If you’re editing code, take a few minutes to determine the coding style of the component and apply the same style.

    * To maintain uniformity in all text-editors, set TAB size to 2 or 4 spaces and replace TAB by SPACES

    * If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too.
    
    * If the comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

    
2. All Ent Services must have a callsign with a prefix of `org.rdk`. Ent Service name must be CamelCase and start with a capital letter.

3.  Inter-plugin communication - There might be use cases where one Ent Service needs to call APIs in another Ent Service. Don't use JSON-RPC for such communication since it's an overhead and not preferred for inter-plugin communication. JSON-RPC must be used only by applications. So, in such cases, use COM RPC.

## Versioning ##

* Versioning

TO BE UPDATED!!

* Changelog

TO BE UPDATED!!

* Deprecation
    * Breaking changes to the API should first go through Deprecation. Following needs to be done for deprecation.
        * The API/s getting deprecated should be marked with a ["deprecated"] label in the json schema. This will ensure that it's updated in the API documentation.
        * [TO DO: CHECK IF THIS LINE ITEM IS REQUIRED] Add a changelog entry with minor version update and include **Deprecated** label to call out the API/s getting deprecated. 
        * [TO DO: CHECK IF THIS LINE ITEM IS REQUIRED] If this API/s is getting replaced by a newer API then it can come in the same minor version update with changelog entry with **Added** label.

## Code Review Checklist ##

This checklist is primarily intended for maintainers or reviewers. Please check for the following before approving Pull Requests.

* [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines) are followed. 
* [TO DO: CHECK IF THIS LINE ITEM IS REQUIRED] API Changes are [documented](#documentation) and [versioned](#versioning).
* Approve Pull Requests to develop branch only. Moving changes from develop branch to main branch will be taken care by maintainers at the appropriate time.
